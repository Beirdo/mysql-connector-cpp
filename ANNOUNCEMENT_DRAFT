Dear MySQL Users,

A new connector has been made available: MySQL Connector/C++. The MySQL Connector/C++ provides a C++ API for connecting client applications to the MySQL Server. You can download a preview at:

  http://downloads.mysql.com/forge/connector_cplusplus

The MySQL Connector/C++ mimics the JDBC 3.0 API. JDBC is a commonly known and well designed API. The Connector/C++ preview implements about 75% of the methods of the following classes of the JDBC 3.0 API:

 * Connection
 * DatabaseMetaData
 * Driver
 * PreparedStatement
 * ResultSet
 * ResultSetMetaData
 * Savepoint
 * Statement

Using MySQL Connector/C++ instead of the MySQL C API (MySQL Client Library) offers the following advantages for C++ users:

 * Convenience of pure C++ - no C function calls
 * Support of a well designed API - JDBC 3.0
 * Support of a commonly known and well documented API - JDBC 3.0
 * Support of the object oriented programming paradigma
 * Shorter development times

You can find further details, including usage examples, on the projects MySQL Forge wiki page at:

  http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Connector_C%2B%2B

Please note that the MySQL Connector/C++ is released as a Software Preview. We do not recommend using it in production environments or systems with critical data.

Feedback, bug reports, bug fixes, patches and so on are welcome and appreciated:
